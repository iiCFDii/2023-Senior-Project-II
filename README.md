Repository for all Autonomous Food Delivery Drone Software including: Landing Sequence, Obstacle Avoidance, Route Mapping, Website Communication, etc


We are designing an autonomous food delivery drone that will operate on university premises. The drone will be equipped with a payload carrying apparatus that will be used to transport food to predetermined locations. For the scope of this project, we expect the drone to be able to carry a bag of chips between a docking location and a landing location. The docking station doubles as a charging station for the drone where orders will be loaded by a person. Orders will be placed online using a mobile application that displays the current food and ordering availability for the food hub. The drone will use some method to indicate completion of food preparation and estimated time of drop-off. The drone will follow a pre-planned flight path to the desired drop-off location. Once the drone arrives at the drop off location, a QR code can be scanned by the customer to verify delivery and signal the drone to return to its docking station.
	The general requirements for this project involve a programmable drone where we can implement mapped flight, a server client where orders can be fulfilled through and submitted, as well as a mobile app interface where orders can be placed.
